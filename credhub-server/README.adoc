= CredHub server

This directory contains artifacts that can be used to start UAA and CredHub servers that can be used to run tests against.
It is derived https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/credhub-docker and https://github.com/ampersand8/credhub-docker.

From the root of this directory, start the servers using Docker Compose:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose up
----

After both servers have started successfully, UAA will be available at `http://localhost:8080/uaa` and CredHub will be available at `https://localhost:9000`.


To generate the test jwt signing keys, ensure the `openssl` and https://carvel.dev/ytt/[`ytt`] tools are installed, the run the setup script:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./setup-uaa.sh
----
